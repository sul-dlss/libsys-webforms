# Library Systems Webforms App

This is a Rails application to be a front-end for various Symphony reporting & updating tools. Intended to replace the web forms generated from the 'sulohs' servers.

## Requirements
1. Ruby (2.1.1 or greater)
2. Rails (4.2.0 or greater)
3. An Instance of Symphony to connect to
4. Oracle client

## Installation

Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/sul-dlss/libsys-webforms.git
```

Change directories into the app and install dependencies
```
bundle install
```

## Development

Libsys-Webforms depends on a backing Oracle production database, so when running the project in development, you will need to run the `ruby-oci8` gem and the `activerecord-oracle_enhanced-adapter` as a pass-through to the development sqlite database. If you get a `ConnectionAdapters::OracleEnhancedAdapter` error when running a rails or rake task, temporarily add `:development` to the group that contains the oracle gems:

```ruby
group :production, :development do
  gem 'activerecord-oracle_enhanced-adapter', '~> 1.6.0'
  gem 'ruby-oci8'
end
```
<strong>...but do not commit this change, and revert it before deployment!</strong>

The various oracle gems (including the plsql gem) use an initializer ([`config/initializers/oracle.rb`](https://github.com/sul-dlss/libsys-webforms/blob/master/config/initializers/oracle.rb)) to configure the oracle emulations. See that file for more information about the configuration.

#### Setting up fixtures for development

In order to have the tables populated for testing the app in development you should load the fixture data into the tables with:
```
RAILS_ENV=development rake db:seed
```
You should also set up a user for you to use when testing the app in development. Do this in the Rails Console:

```
> rails c

2.3.4 :001 > au=AuthorizedUser.new
2.3.4 :002 > au.user_id = 'some-user'
2.3.4 :003 > au.user_name = 'Some User'
2.3.4 :004 > au.mgt_rpts = 'Y'
2.3.4 :005 > au.unicorn_updates = 'Y'
2.3.4 :006 > au.sal3_batch_req = 'Y'
2.3.4 :007 > au.sal3_breq_edit = 'Y'
2.3.4 :008 > au.save
```

Start the development server
```
REMOTE_USER=some-user rails s
```

## Testing

#### Running the migrations for test

Before running the tests with rake you should run the migrations in the `test` environment by running:
```
RAILS_ENV=test rake db:test:prepare
RAILS_ENV=test rake db:seed
```

NOTE: Travis uses `db:test:prepare` rather than `db:migrate`

### Rake, etc.
The test suite (with RuboCop style enforcement) will be run with the default rake task (also run on travis)

    $ rake

The specs can be run without RuboCop enforcement

    $ rake spec

The RuboCop style enforcement can be run without running the tests

    $ rake rubocop

## Deployment

To deploy to development:

    $ cap dev deploy

## Command-line tasks

There are some command-line tools the application provides.
For example, to upload and delete batches:

    $ bundle exec rake webforms:change_current_location[:path_to_file,:current_lib,:new_curloc,:email, :comments]
    $ bundle exec rake webforms:delete_batch[batch_id]    

## Ckey2Bibframe Webform

The "Ckey2Bibframe" webform allows you to enter a Symphony ckey and view <strong>marc21-to-xml</strong> and <strong>marcxml-to-bibframe2</strong> results in the browser. In order for this functionality to work you must install the <a href="https://github.com/lcnetdev/marc2bibframe2">LOC Marc2Bibframe2 Converter</a> and place it under this application's root. Running the LOC marc2bibframe2 converter via libsys-webforms requires the `xsltproc` command-line tool be installed on your system (see http://www.xmlsoft.org). After cloning this project, simply `cd libsys-webforms` and then `git clone https://github.com/lcnetdev/marc2bibframe2.git`. If it is not already there, you must also create a `lib/xform-marc21-to-xml-jar-with-dependencies.jar` file that is compiled from https://github.com/sul-dlss/ld4p-marc21-to-xml (see https://github.com/sul-dlss/ld4p-marc21-to-xml#compiling-and-executing, it should be placed in this app's lib folder as well).

## PL/SQL Jobs

Based on the configuration of a `pl_sql_job` in the settings/{environment}.yml file, e.g.:
```yml
pl_sql_jobs:
  circ_stats_job:
    text: 'Circ stats report daily processing'
    command: 'circ_stats_rpt.daily_processing'
    sunet_ids:
      - 'usera'
      - 'userb'
```
links with collapsed "Run" buttons will automatically be created on the home page and will only appear for people who are logged in and listed in the sunet_ids section of the config. Clicking the "Run" link will execute the configured PL/SQL command via the already configured OCI8 connection gem (using the environment's database.yml connection details). If more jobs need to be added in the future, just fill out a new section under the pl_sql_jobs section in the https://github.com/sul-dlss/shared_configs repository and follow the instructions there for deploying to the application server.

## Lobbytrack Report

The lobbytrack database connection settings are kept in the Settings config file along with an array of IP addresses that 
have firewall access to the lobbytrack database and can also use this webform. Inclusion of the client IP address here will 
allow the Lobbytrack report menu item to appear for only cliets with the IPs listed here:
```yml
# Lobbytrack settings
lobbytrack_host: '-----'
lobbytrack_user: '-----'
lobbytrack_password: '-----'
lobbytrack_db: '-----'
lobbytrack_port: -----
lobbytrack_ips: ['1.1.1.1', '2.2.2.2']
```
